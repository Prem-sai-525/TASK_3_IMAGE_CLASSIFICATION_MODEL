**Overview of the Image Classification Model**

üß† Objective:
The aim of this project is to build and train an Image Classification Model using deep learning. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories (e.g., cats vs. dogs, digits, or other objects) by learning from labeled image data.

üßæ Core Components:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Loads image data, often from a directory structure where folders represent class labels.

Applies preprocessing steps such as:

Resizing images

Normalizing pixel values

Splitting data into training and validation sets

2. Data Augmentation (Optional)
Applies transformations like rotation, flipping, and zoom to increase dataset diversity.

Helps improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.

3. Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is defined using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow/Keras.

Typical layers include:

Convolutional layers (for feature extraction)

MaxPooling layers (for dimensionality reduction)

Fully connected (Dense) layers

Dropout (for regularization)

Output layer with softmax or sigmoid activation

4. Model Compilation and Training
The model is compiled with:

Loss function: e.g., categorical crossentropy

Optimizer: e.g., Adam

Metrics: e.g., accuracy

Trained using the preprocessed image dataset.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated on validation/test data using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Loss

Confusion Matrix (if included)

6. Prediction
The trained model is used to predict the class of new, unseen images.

‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details
Developed using Python with frameworks such as:

TensorFlow/Keras for model building

Matplotlib for visualization

NumPy/Pandas for data manipulation

Focuses on end-to-end image classification from raw image input to model prediction.
